# Under the Hood: The Dataset
In this one-pager, we explore the temporal rhythms of traffic congestion across major U.S. cities—zeroing in on New York and Los Angeles. What if the when of traffic mattered just as much as the where?

To drive this analysis, we use the U.S. Traffic Congestions (2016–2022) dataset, compiled by Sobhan Moosavi. It contains detailed records of congestion incidents across major urban areas, based on real-time traffic reports. The dataset was last accessed on May 10, 2025. For consistency and completeness, our analysis focuses exclusively on congestion data from 2016 through 2022—the full available range.

Looking at the heatmaps above, it’s clear that some areas in both New York and Los Angeles deal with much heavier traffic congestion than others. In New York, places like the intersection of West Street and Battery Place, Washington Mews and 5th Avenue, and 6th Avenue near Central Park South stand out. These are all busy parts of the city where a lot of streets come together, so it’s not surprising they get backed up. Making improvements to the infrastructure in these areas could really help ease the flow.

In Los Angeles, the worst congestion spots are mostly found in the Boyle Heights area. The top three are the merge between the Santa Monica and Golden State Freeways, the split between the Golden State and San Bernardino Freeways, and the merge between the Santa Ana and San Bernardino Freeways. These are big freeway junctions that see a lot of traffic every day. If the city focused on improving how traffic moves through these spots, it could make a real difference for drivers across L.A.
