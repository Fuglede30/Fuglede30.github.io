# Suspect: The Dataset
In this one-pager, we explore distinct temporal patterns in crimes across San Francisco — focusing on Robbery, Assault, and Weapon Law crimes. What if the timing of these crimes could tell us more than the crimes themselves?
To support this exploration, the dataset used in this analysis consists of reported crime incidents in San Fransisco from 2003 till present and is sourced from the [San Fransisco Police Department Incident Reports](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?category=Public+Safety&sortBy=relevance&page=1&pageSize=20). The data was accessed on June 2, 2025, which serves as the cutoff date. To ensure consistency and complete annual coverage, we focus exclusively on data from 2003 to 2024.
