# Under the Hood: The Dataset
In this one-pager, we explore the temporal rhythms of traffic congestion across major U.S. cities—zeroing in on New York and Los Angeles. What if the when of traffic mattered just as much as the where?

To drive this analysis, we use the U.S. Traffic Congestions (2016–2022) dataset, compiled by Sobhan Moosavi. It contains detailed records of congestion incidents across major urban areas, based on real-time traffic reports. The dataset was last accessed on May 10, 2025. For consistency and completeness, our analysis focuses exclusively on congestion data from 2016 through 2022—the full available range.

As we see in the map above there are certain areas that have way more traffic congestions than others. especially places as the cross over between west street and Battery place, washington mews and 5th avenue, 6th avenue and central park south. improving the infrastructure in these places could lead to better traffic flow in the city overall.

the top tree places of where most of traffic congestion happens are the merging between Sanata Monica Freeway and Golden State Freeway, the split between Golden State Freeway and San Bernadine Freeway and the merging between Santa Ana Freeway and San Bernadino Freeway. All of this happens in the Boyle Heights district.
